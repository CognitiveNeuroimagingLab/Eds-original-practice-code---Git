# **HelloGitWorld-pgmNotes.md**
## Intro  


“*HelloGitWorld.m*” is a Matlab script for testing Git and Kitraken.  
It reads a list of “**projectMembers**” from a text file ("*members.txt*"") and calls a function (“*print_members.m*”) to display the list.


## Variables
* *ProjectMembers* - cell array of {'firstname','lastname'} strings
## Files
* **members.txt** - ASCII file of members names; 'firstname','lastname' on each line
## Subroutines
* readMembers.m - reads **members.txt** and displays list
## Bugs & Quirks
* **a basically useless program ;)**
## Future Features
* add project roles
* add snide comments :()
* another line
